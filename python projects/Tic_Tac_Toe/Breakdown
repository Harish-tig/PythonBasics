Game Board Display:
The game board is displayed using a simple ASCII representation.
Each position on the board is numbered from 1 to 9.

Starting the Game:
Players are prompted to choose either 'X' or 'O' for their symbols. If player 1 chooses 'X', player 2 automatically gets 'O', and vice versa.

Win Checking:
There's a function to check if a player has won the game. 
It checks all possible winning combinations on the board.

Player Turn:
Players take turns making their moves.
They choose a position on the board where they want to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').

Replay Function:
After a game ends, players are asked if they want to play again. If they choose 'Y', the game restarts.
If they choose 'N', the program exits.

Main Function:
The main function initializes the game board, displays it, and starts the game loop. It continues until there's a winner or a tie.
